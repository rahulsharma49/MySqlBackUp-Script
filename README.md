# MySqlBackUp-Script

This script will help you to create backup of all MySql dump files. You just need to run this script from your SSH and then it will backup all sql data files.

By default it will make a folder of **sqlBackup** at **/home/sqlBackup**. If you want to change the location, then just simply edit the line 15 and mention you desired location.
